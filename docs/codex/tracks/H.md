# Track H — communications and chat

Status: ready-for-integration (H-owned work and gates are green; Phase 10 completion awaits the listed A/C/G work)
Branch: `track/h-comms` (local only; no push)
Merged trunk: `rebuild/trunk` at `1b6777d` (including the dependency merge at `8f6ec98`)
Local range: `c577d62..HEAD` (includes the resolved trunk merge and H follow-ups)
Migration range: `4000–4006`

## Delivered

- Campaign APIs and composer for people, teams, programs and roles; registration-status and past-due filters; bilingual merge fields; live draft and saved previews; in-app/email/SMS/push channel selection; test send; schedule/cancel; delivery stats; and emergency broadcasts restricted to owner/admin.
- Delivery uses Track C's email/SMS/push adapters, stores provider message IDs for signed Resend/Twilio status callbacks, and applies dedupe, guardian routing, preferences, suppression, SMS consent, shared quiet-hours rules and bounded retries. Development and tests use preview, fake or Mailpit adapters.
- In-app campaign, emergency and chat events pass their Phase 10 type IDs (`communications.campaign`, `communications.emergency`, `communications.chat_message`) through Track B's notification catalog. H's en/es templates are exported from the communications module and checked against B's catalog IDs.
- Tokenized email unsubscribe applies the category preference and offers Track B's `preferencesCenterPath(orgId)` in the localized confirmation page.
- Team/staff chat uses the shared SafeSport policy, includes guardians, rejects unguarded adult/minor direct conversations, supports read receipts, mute, edits/soft deletion, moderation and report-to-compliance, and publishes inbox/SSE notifications through Track B.
- Unread chat fallback batches by conversation and recipient for ten minutes from the first message (DEC-063). It rechecks active membership, mute and unread state, uses Track B operational preferences, sends push first and email only as fallback, defers push through shared quiet hours, redacts message content, and retries provider failures. Migrations `4005`–`4006` store tenant-scoped batch state and its foreign-key indexes.
- Person and household message-history APIs and internal attachment references are present. Added Phase 10 browser journeys for campaign composition/preview/test/schedule-cancel and portal chat send; both run in Chromium and WebKit mobile with axe checks.
- `npm run gen:module communications` was run; it declined to overwrite the existing module. Generated registry and OpenAPI were refreshed.

## Verification

- Targeted H Postgres integration tests: 21 passed. Coverage includes tenant and role enforcement, all Phase 10 notification IDs, tokenized unsubscribe destination, provider-ID callbacks, chat grouping, unread/muted suppression, push/email preferences and quiet-hour deferral.
- Full `npm test`: 178 files passed, 1 skipped; 679 tests passed, 1 skipped.
- H Playwright journeys: 4 passed across Chromium desktop and WebKit mobile. Full `npm run test:e2e`: 40 passed, 4 skipped; axe checks in the H journeys reported no serious or critical violations.
- `npm run db:migrate` applied migrations `4005_chat_notification_batches.sql` and `4006_chat_notification_batch_indexes.sql`; `npm run db:codegen` introspected 157 tables.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run registry`, `npm run openapi` and `git diff --check` passed. Build emitted upstream dependency/chunk-size advisories only.
- No real email, SMS or push was sent. The branch was not pushed.

## Remaining work owned by other tracks

- **A:** Link H history from person/household profiles; capture consent when a verified phone is entered; expose `programs.settings.communications.athleteChatEnabled`; call H's existing team/staff conversation synchronization after roster, staff, guardian-link and setting changes; add coach-to-16-year-old guardian-copy and remaining Phase 10 Chromium/WebKit mobile journeys with axe; surface bounce suppressions in Action Center.
- **C:** Authorize family chat attachment upload/download for active same-organization conversation members in the Files module.
- **G:** Coalesce five schedule changes within fifteen minutes into one family communication.

## Completion boundary

Track B's catalog/preferences and Track C's provider-ID interface are on the merged trunk and wired by H. Track H-owned work is complete and ready for integration. Overall Phase 10 still awaits the A/C/G items above and their acceptance journeys.
