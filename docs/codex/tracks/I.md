# Track I — academy / class mode (Phase 12)

Status: ready for integration
Model: Codex (GPT-6 Luna XH)
Branch: `track/i-academy`
Worktree: `/Users/sammooney/Sport-i-academy`
Owns: `server/src/modules/classes/**`, `web/src/console/classes/**`, `web/src/portal/classes/**`, own tests, migrations 5000–5999, this file.

## Ready for integration

- Class backend, console and family portal are implemented; nested route discovery now includes both academy route files in `web/src/generated/nested-routes.ts`.
- Focused academy integration (17 tests), family portal component test, Chromium make-up journey, and schema spine (4 tests) pass; migration 5006 indexes all academy foreign keys, and the full trunk merge gate remains pending.

## Requests to other tracks

- **C (navigation, 2026-09-27):** add a family-portal Classes link in `PortalShell`. The current nested-route generator now registers `/console/orgs/:orgId/classes` and `/me/orgs/:orgId/classes` without changes to central aggregators.
- **C (stack, 2026-09-27):** I's prescribed `PORT_OFFSET=900` collides with C's active mailpit/Postgres/Stripe listeners (including `127.0.0.1:1925`); I isolated work at offset 1500 and requests a free, stable offset or release of 900 before the final gate.
- **B (program listing, 2026-09-27):** expose published programs filtered by `mode=class` to replace the functional program-ID field with a picker; current Programs API is not present in I's merged trunk.
- **F (compliance):** `role_credential_requirements.role` still has no `instructor`; class instructor and substitute checks use existing `head_coach`/DEC-080 contract until F adds the instructor role.
- **K (Phase 15 seed):** seed Northstar Gymnastics & Swim Academy with class-mode program, 40 classes, 300 students, tuition tiers, skills and schedules.
- **G (scheduling):** ensure facility closure/blackout changes cancel or flag materialized `class_session` events; I's schedule generator skips registered holidays/blackouts at creation time.

## Blocked on

None for Track I-owned Phase 12 acceptance. The portal shell link and other track-owned follow-ups remain requested above.

## Decisions taken

- DEC-109: instructor and substitute eligibility use the existing `head_coach` policy until compliance adds `instructor`.
- DEC-110: monthly tuition autopay requires explicit subscription consent and an invoice-scoped authorization.
- DEC-111: pickup requires an active household permission or verified family links, with check-in required first.
- DEC-112: enrollment locks the offering; session bookings lock the `class_session` capacity counter.
- DEC-113: level promotions defer tuition changes by default and settle only the household's remaining-session delta when immediate.
- I temporarily used `PORT_OFFSET=1500` because the required 900 was occupied; no other track's containers were stopped or changed.
